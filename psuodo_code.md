steps 
first take the input "a" and "b"
assign the input "a" to variable A 
assign the input "b" to variable B 

if A is greater than B then
    ### A = B( number of B in A (X) ) + remainder(C) ###
    if remainder equal(=) zero then 
        print B 
    else loop though 
        ### X = Y( no. of y in x) + remainder(Z) ###
    until  remainder equal(=) 0 then
        print C
else
    swap the roles

code snippet corner
    how to get remainder(C)
    C = A % B
    how to get the no. of B in A(X) / Quointent
    X = A//b
